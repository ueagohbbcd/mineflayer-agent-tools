/**
 * node-canvas `loadImage` wrapper for the Prismarine viewer's texture loads.
 *
 * The viewer loads textures asynchronously (`loadTexture` -> `loadImage`) and
 * the callback has no error channel: a missing file is an uncaught rejection
 * that aborts the whole renderer process, not just that mesh. That can happen
 * when a screenshot includes an entity and the participant image does not ship
 * the entity texture layout the viewer asks for, or when a future viewer
 * version moves a texture again.
 *
 * Resolve a missing viewer texture to a 1x1 transparent PNG instead. The mesh
 * then renders with a fully transparent skin (the material uses alphaTest), so
 * one missing asset costs that entity, not the picture. Each missing source is
 * reported once so the image can be fixed without flooding the render log.
